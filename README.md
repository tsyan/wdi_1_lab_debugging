# Debugging Practice

## Possible bugs: 

* typos
* missing end
* mismatch of datatypes
* nil errors
* = instead of ==
* symbol vs. string keys in hash (though students probably won't know hashes yet)
* various uses of the [ ] method: [1] vs. [something] vs. ["something"] (though students may not know arrays yet)
* various uses of the ( ) argument parens: (something) vs. ("something"), and referring to those within the method definition

## Students will know/be familiar with at this point: 

* methods/scope
* arrays (maybe... depends on how the day is structured)
* datatypes
* variables
* strings + string interpolation
* conditionals
* loops
* NO CLASSES
